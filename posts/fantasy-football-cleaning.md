## Cleaning Messy Fantasy Football Data with Pandas

### Introduction: Why Clean Data Matters

Fantasy football is all about dataâ€”player stats fuel draft picks, lineup decisions, and bragging rights. But raw datasets from sites like Pro-Football-Reference often arrive messy: missing values, cryptic column names, or player names with symbols like * (Pro Bowl) or + (First-Team All-Pro). Cleaning this data is crucial for reliable analysis, whether you're ranking players or building a predictive model. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Pandas to load a messy fantasy football dataset, clean it step-by-step, and prepare it for analysis. By the end, you'll have a tidy dataset ready for visualization or modeling, plus skills to tackle any messy dataset.

We'll work with a sample CSV, fantasy_football_2024.csv, addressing common issues like missing values, inconsistent names, and special characters. Let's get started!
